- My name is Wenday (Wun-day) Seyoum and I'm a data scientist, specialized in geospatial data, modeling, and machine learning. Mostly, I am working with geospatial data, timeseries, machine learning, satellite imageries, and remote sensing. Currently, I am working on multiple projects involving machine learning and satellite remote sensing for application in water resources management.
